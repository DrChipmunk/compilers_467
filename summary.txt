Special problems

1. comments that don't end


We iterate through the tokens until we find '*' followed by '/'. If we reach EOF prior to that, we raise an error flag and terminate the program

2.long variable names

We check the length of yytext and throw an error if it exceeds the max length.

3. large integers

We convert yytext to an integer, compare it to the max value and throw and error if it exceeds the max value.

4.floats

we check for the various valid floats (ex. 0.0, 0) and use atof to account for the correct precision.
